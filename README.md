## Acceptance criteria (must have)
[x] Use of React and Next.js
[x] Git repository
[x] Documentation of your process:
[x] Instructions on how to run the project (e.g. README.md, DEVELOPERLOG.md)
[x] Pages must be fully responsive and mobile friendly
[x] Unit tests - no need to achieve 100% coverage, but rather cover some components to showcase your test writing skills
  `yarn jest`

## What was done
- Products page with internal api integration using faker js and next api structure;
- checkout page with selected product and form validation for all input fields;
